# May 24th - Researching & 3d modelling (A little)
As I'm in Australia, I'll be making this for AUD as I won't be able to have access to other coin currency's to test with. So to start, I just found a graphic of the AUD coin sizes.

After I found the sizes, I brainstormed and researched ways to do this (noting that some coin sizes are very similiar)
I then decided the rough parts I need. This is probably going to change tho. I think I need:

-Camera

-Servo

-Raspberry pi (of some sort)

-3d printed design (pretty much the main part since they are sorted by size)


Then I started making a draft 3d model. After about 40 minutes it turned out, it's easier to start with an empty box and build it inside, rather than start with a solid cube and try and make holes through it. (I know, I'm bad at 3d modelling - I don't have that much experience) This allows for easier access to inside, and gives more room for the electronics so I can make it as small as possible. I ended up with this - which would probably take a more experienced person 5 minutes to make. Right now it doesn't look like much so I'll continue it tomorrow.

# May 25th - 3d modelling (again)

So today, I guess I'll just be doing more 3d modelling. 

My bad, I need a light as well, otherwise the camera won't be able to see anything.

Will update soon...
