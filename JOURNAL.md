# May 24th - Researching & 3d modelling (A little)
As I'm in Australia, I'll be making this for AUD as I won't be able to have access to other coin currency's to test with. So to start, I just found a graphic of the AUD coin sizes.

After I found the sizes, I brainstormed and researched ways to do this (noting that some coin sizes are very similiar)
I then decided the rough parts I need. This is probably going to change tho. I think I need:

-Camera

-Servo

-Raspberry pi (of some sort)

-3d printed design (pretty much the main part since they are sorted by size)


Then I started making a draft 3d model. After about 40 minutes it turned out, it's easier to start with an empty box and build it inside, rather than start with a solid cube and try and make holes through it. (I know, I'm bad at 3d modelling - I don't have that much experience) This allows for easier access to inside, and gives more room for the electronics so I can make it as small as possible. I ended up with this - which would probably take a more experienced person 5 minutes to make. Right now it doesn't look like much so I'll continue it tomorrow.

# May 25th - 3d modelling (again)

So today, I guess I'll just be doing more 3d modelling. 

My bad, I need a light as well, otherwise the camera won't be able to see anything.

I've also made like a gear thing to make the coins feed in. Here's what I ended up with today. Getting the holes right for the coins is very fiddly and time consuming.

**Time spent: 1h 23min**

**Total time spent: 3h 10min**

# May 26th - 3d modelling (still)

I have homework so probably can't spend too much time today.
I've finished all the holes for the parts the coins drop into. I figuired it was easier to do the holes when the base was flat, not in position. Other than that, didn't do much.

**Time spent: 37min**

**Total time spent: 3h 47min**

# May 27 - 3d modelling (for what seems like eternity) and a little bit of research

I really didn't do much today. I put the coin sorter part in position and will do the angles tomorrow.

After some time thinking and researching I've decided it will be easier to load cells (basically scales) to measure how many coins rather then trying to line up the coins for the photo-interrupter. The current dimensions are about 10x30x6cm which is still smaller than any other. I'm designing this to be portable, so if I have the space, I might put a small battery or powerbank to make it easier.

**Total time spent: 4h 12min**
